## üìí **About**
Ever thought about how shells work? How commands are executed? How your input is decyphered into commands and arguments? This is a chance of learning about input parsing, processes, signals, pipelines and more!

The implementation of this project is based on the original ``Bourne-Again Shell (BASH)`` although some details were customized or not implemented (e.g. unclosed pipes).

## **Mandatory Part**

Here's a list of features our minishell has:

	- A prompt with powerlevel10k inspired theme;
	- Lexer and parser for the input;
	- A working history;
	- Builtin commands such as echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env and exit;
	- Signal handling for ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\\;
	- Pipelining of commands;
	- Redirection of input and output;
	- Environment variables;
	- Direct declaration of temporary environment variables (A=3);
	- Expansion of environment variables ($HOME, $PWD, etc) and exit status ($?);

## üö® **Disclaimer**
At 42, the C projects are built following a bunch of rules that enforce good coding style. Some of them are:

	- No for, do while, switch, case or goto are allowed
	- No more than 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file
	- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static)
	- No more than 5 variables in 1 function

## üì¶ **Compilation**
To compile minishell you should run `make` in the terminal.

This rule will generate a `minishell` file, which is the zipped version of all the object files. To launch the executable you should follow this syntax...

```sh
$ ./minishell
```

## üí´ **Testing**

This project was tested using self-made tests and other colleagues pressure tests.
